#' Mercury Concentration Differences for Matched NHANES Respondents.
#'
#' Differences in total mercury concentration in the blood (in
#' micrograms per mole) for subjects in 1,672 matched pairs.
#' Each pair contains two respondents to the National Health and
#' Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during the period 2007-
#' 2016, one who reported consuming 15 or more servings of fish
#' per month, and one who reported consuming two or fewer
#' servings per month.  Positive differences indicate that the
#' respondent consuming more fish had a higher mercury
#' concentration.  These data are described in greater detail
